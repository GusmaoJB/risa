\title{Generate decay coefficient rasters}
\usage{
decay_coeffs(
  raster,
  raster2 = NULL,
  decay = c("none", "linear", "exponential", "polynomial_2nd", "polynomial_3rd",
    "complementary_decay_2nd", "complementary_decay_3rd"),
  buffer_m
)
}
\arguments{
\item{raster}{A [terra::SpatRaster] with non-NA source cells from which distances are measured.}

\item{raster2}{Optional [terra::SpatRaster] to mask the output decay coefficients (only keep cells where `raster2` is not NA).}

\item{decay}{Character string specifying the decay function (see above).}

\item{buffer_m}{Numeric. Buffer distance in meters. Beyond this distance decay values are set to 0 (or NA if masked).}
}
\value{
A [terra::SpatRaster] with decay coefficients in \[0, 1\].
}
\description{
Computes spatially explicit decay coefficients around non-NA cells of a
reference raster. The decay describes how values decrease with distance
from the source cells, up to a specified buffer distance (meters).
}
\details{
Supported decay types:
\describe{
  \item{`none`}{No decay. All cells within the buffer are set to 1, outside 0.}
  \item{`linear`}{Linear decrease from 1 at the source to 0 at the buffer edge.}
  \item{`exponential`}{Exponential decrease from 1 at the source to near 0 at the buffer edge
  (rate chosen so that value â‰ˆ 1e-6 at `buffer_m`).}
  \item{`polynomial_2nd`}{Quadratic polynomial decay: \eqn{(1 - d / buffer_m)^2}, convex decreasing.}
  \item{`polynomial_3rd`}{Cubic polynomial decay: \eqn{(1 - d / buffer_m)^3}, convex decreasing.}
  \item{`complementary_decay_2nd`}{Complementary quadratic: \eqn{1 - (d / buffer_m)^2},
  flat near 1 then dropping sharply near buffer edge.}
  \item{`complementary_decay_3rd`}{Complementary cubic: \eqn{1 - (d / buffer_m)^3},
  even flatter near 1, sharper drop near buffer edge.}
}


The function requires a projected (metric) CRS. Geographic (lon/lat) rasters must
be reprojected before use.
