\title{Read spatial files into a nested list mirroring directory structure}
\usage{
read_maps_nested(dir_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir_path}{`character(1)`. Path to the root directory containing your spatial data.
Subdirectories will be traversed recursively and represented as nested list elements.}
}
\value{
A `list` of arbitrary depth:
  - Intermediate elements are named by subdirectory names and contain further lists.
  - Leaf elements are named by file basenames and contain `SpatRaster` or `sf` objects.
}
\description{
This function scans a root directory (non‐recursively at each level) for raster
files (`.tif`, `.tiff`) and shapefiles (`.shp`), reads them as `terra::SpatRaster`
or `sf` objects, respectively, and builds a nested R list whose names correspond
to folder and file basenames (without extensions).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Suppose your files are organized like:
# data/
# ├─ regionA/
# │  ├─ landcover.tif
# │  └─ roads.shp
# └─ regionB/
#    └─ zone1/
#       └─ elevation.tif

maps <- read_maps_nested("data")
# Access the landcover raster:
maps$regionA$landcover
# Access the roads sf object:
maps$regionA$roads
# Access the elevation raster:
maps$regionB$zone1$elevation
}
