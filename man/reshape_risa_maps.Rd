\title{Reshape nested species–stressor maps into a standardized structure}
\usage{
reshape_risa_maps(
  risa_maps,
  criteria_names,
  only_species = NULL,
  only_stressors = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{risa_maps}{A nested list (class `"risaMaps"`) containing species
distributions, stressor distributions, kernel maps, overlap maps, and other
elements as produced by the \pkg{risa} workflow.}

\item{criteria_names}{Character vector of length 2. Names assigned to the two
elements in each species–stressor pair: the first corresponds to the
stressor intensity map (from `stressor_kernel_maps`), and the second to the
likelihood of interaction map (from `overlap_maps`). For example:
`c("intensity", "likelihood of interaction")`.}

\item{only_species}{Optional character vector. Subset of species names to
include. Defaults to all available species.}

\item{only_stressors}{Optional character vector. Subset of stressor names to
include. Defaults to all available stressors.}
}
\value{
A nested list structured as
  \preformatted{
  list(
    species1 = list(
      stressor1 = list(
        <criteria_names[1]> = SpatRaster,
        <criteria_names[2]> = SpatRaster
      ),
      stressor2 = list(...)
    ),
    species2 = list(...)
  )
  }
  Species or stressors with no valid data are omitted.
}
\description{
This function reorganizes a complex list of nested species and stressor maps
(a `risaMaps` object, output from `risa_maps`) into a simplified structure. For each
species–stressor pair, it extracts the stressor intensity map
(`stressor_kernel_maps`) and the overlap map (`overlap_maps`) and returns
them as a named list with user-defined criteria names.
